It is an “emotional & intelligent” species with feelings, compassion and self-awareness. Elephants present tremendous challenges for their successful conservation (Large size, feeding behaviour and mobility). It is also an “umbrella” species, whose protection provides collateral security for overall biodiversity & tourism industry. A “conflict” and “engineer” species, capable of modifying habitats to the benefit or detriment of different plant and animal species on a local or wider scale.

The African savannah elephants are currently listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</div></div><button class='menu'>What are the present threat to elephant conservation in Kenya?<span class='arrow rarrow'>+</span><span class='arrow darrow'>-</span></button><div class='panel close'><div style="padding:10px"><ul><li><p>Degrading / declining habitat</p></li><li><p>Ivory poaching</p></li><li><p>Human-elephant conflict</p></li><li><p>Climate change and diseases</p></li><li><p>Limited resources (worsened by COVID 19 pandemic)</p></li></ul></div></div><button class='menu'>Intervention & where support is required for elephants?<span class='arrow rarrow'>+</span><span class='arrow darrow'>-</span></button><div class='panel close'><div style="padding:10px"><ul><li><p>Conservation education and community engagement</p></li><li><p>Securing connectivity in critical habitats</p></li><li><p>Employing new technology including Collaring to provide data and information on habitat use and infrastructure development, Innovative and Light-based deterrents for early detection and warning</p></li><li><p>Over the years, there has been a gradual change in elephant death from poaching to human elephant conflict (HEC), natural and unknown causes.
