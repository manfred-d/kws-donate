<h3><span><span><span>Edward Norton: Our Tembo Naming Festival Ambassador</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Renowned actor, writer, director and producer Edward Norton, joined the cause as the Tembo Naming Festival’s official brand ambassador. Aside from being an award-winning actor, Norton has been a committed social and environmental activist for many years. He was named a Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity by the United Nations in 2010 and proudly lends his voice and support for the Tembo Naming Festival and its mission. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Our Amboseli Mission</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">We selected </span><strong><span lang="EN-US">Amboseli National Park</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"> as the launch point for our campaign. The Park is one of Kenya’s premium parks and a must-visit tourist destination and prides itself as a park with the longest-running study of wild elephants ever undertaken globally. The majestic elephants of Amboseli themselves are known worldwide for their calm personalities.<br />
&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Only about 40% of elephants around Amboseli are known </span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><strong><span>to use Amboseli National Park during dry seasons.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">It is therefore very important that we salvage some of the less disturbed areas around the park to create more space for our elephants. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span><span><span>A place to call home</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The </span><strong><span lang="EN-US">MKTNF aims to raise funds to secure these important areas</span></strong> <strong><span lang="EN-US">for elephants</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"> to live safely and to promote human-elephant co-existence. It is going to cost about KES 100,000,000 </span><strong><span lang="EN-US">over 860,000 USD</span></strong><span lang="EN-US"> to secure this space and ensure sustainable conservation in the Amboseli ecosystem. </span></span></span></span></p>
